## pearls

A social generative sculpture, to which visitors can contribute by adding or deleting pearls. These changes are then updated (more-or-less) real-time to other visitors on the website. Visitors have the choice to do as they please, and build whatever they want (keeping in mind that it might at any time be deleted by another visitor!).
